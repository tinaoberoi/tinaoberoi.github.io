      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, I'm a student at the University of Chicago, currently diving into the world of quantum and all the wild possibilities it holds. I'm especially interested in the theory side of things, and I try to bring my coding skills and curiosity into everything I do.
        Outside of academics, I like to stay activeâ€”just finished my first half marathon (still recovering, kind of) and already planning the next. I also love lifting, swimming, and hunting down great food. Oh, and dogs? Big fan. I actually built a VS Code extension in honor of my late pup, Bruno.
        If youâ€™ve got recommendations for scenic runs or dog-friendly eats, Iâ€™m all ears.</p>

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>My research interests lie at the intersection of quantum computing and high-performance computing (HPC). Iâ€™m particularly curious about how classical HPC techniques can be integrated with quantum systems to optimize performance and reduce computational overhead. After working with variational quantum algorithms, Iâ€™ve become increasingly interested in understanding what makes a problem inherently hard to solveâ€”and how we can push the boundaries of algorithmic efficiency in quantum contexts.
        Iâ€™m also drawn to the challenges of quantum error correction, especially in developing more efficient decoding strategies that are realistic for near-term quantum hardware. As quantum systems evolve, I believe improving the practicality and scalability of decoders will be essential to their viability.
        My ongoing projects explore these questions from both theoretical and implementation-driven perspectives, aiming to contribute to the broader effort of making quantum computing more accessible, stable, and powerful.</p>
